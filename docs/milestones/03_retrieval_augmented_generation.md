# Milestone 03 – Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Objective
Index embeddings and pair retrieval with generative reasoning to improve answer accuracy.

## Checklist
- Stand up an initial vector store such as Chroma or Qdrant.
- Prototype baseline RAG chains and prompt templates for your corpus.
- Iterate with reranking, hybrid search, and caching strategies.
