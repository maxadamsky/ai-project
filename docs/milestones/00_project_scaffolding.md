# Milestone 00 – Project Scaffolding

## Objective
Establish a clean, opinionated baseline for the AI Learning Studio so future experiments have a reliable home.

## Key tasks completed
- Added a Python package skeleton with a CLI for exploring the learning roadmap.
- Created documentation directories for the learning journal and milestone notes.
- Drafted the initial testing harness using the standard library `unittest` module.

## Next steps
1. Install development dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`) and configure pre-commit hooks.
2. Use `python -m ai_learning_studio.cli --next --after 0` to review the upcoming learning focus.
3. Follow `docs/milestones/01_llm_fundamentals.md` to provision a local LLM runtime (e.g., Ollama) and document findings.
