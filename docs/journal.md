# Learning Journal

## 2024-XX-XX – Project kickoff
- Clarified the vision for the AI Learning Studio: a modular laboratory that doubles as a useful assistant.
- Created the initial repository scaffolding with dedicated folders for source code, documentation, notebooks, and tests.
- Captured the multi-phase roadmap in code to make it queryable from the CLI.
- Next: install dependencies, run `python -m ai_learning_studio.cli --next --after 0`, and start experimenting with local LLM tooling using the plan in `docs/milestones/01_llm_fundamentals.md`.
